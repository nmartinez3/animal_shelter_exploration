Hey guys, this is a project I did for the Austin Animal Center where I looked at over 38,000+ animals in Austin, TX animal shelters and built a statistical model to predict future animal outcomes. In this project, I...

•	Predicted the outcome for animals in Austin, TX animal shelters using a data set with 10 predictors and 38,000 observations

•	Engineered new predictor variables out of the old data to better explain animal outcomes

•	Visualized and explored the relationships between each predictor and the response variable in order to better inform the feature engineering and model building process

•	Imputed missing values using a predictive model to predict the correct values for each observation

•	Built a random forest model that predicted animal outcome with a 68% success rate using R

•	Documented the entire process with custom visualizations and fully reproducible code using knitr

Unfortunately, github can't display the final write up for this project in its intended form, so please **go to this url** http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/nmartinez3/animal_shelter_exploration/blob/master/animal_shelter_exploration_and_analysis.html to view my final project.

All feedback is welcome; please email n_martinez3@u.pacific.edu with any suggestions/tips/concerns/comments/etc.
