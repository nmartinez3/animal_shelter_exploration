Hey guys, this is a project I did for the Austin Animal Center where I looked at over 38,000+ animals in Austin, TX animal shelters and built a statistical model to predict future animal outcomes.

Please view the .html file, as that is the finished project with all the bells and whistles. Thank you.

All feedback is welcome; please email n_martinez3@u.pacific.edu with any suggestions/tips/concerns/comments/etc.
