# Austin, TX Animal Shelter Data Exploration (Kaggle)

**[Analysis here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/nmartinez3/animal_shelter_exploration/blob/master/animal_shelter_exploration_and_analysis.html)**
***
This is a project I did through Kaggle on data from the Austin Animal Center where I looked at 38,000+ shelter dogs and cats in Austin, TX and built a statistical model to predict their outcomes from the shelter (adopted, death :(, others). Among other things, I:

•	Predicted the outcome for animals in Austin, TX animal shelters using a data set with 10 predictors and 38,000 observations

•	Engineered new independent variables out of the old data to better explain animal outcomes

•	Visualized and explored the relationships between each predictor and the response variable in order to better inform the feature engineering and model building process

•	Imputed missing values using a predictive model to predict the correct values for each observation

•	Built a random forest model that predicted animal outcome with a 68% success rate using R

•	Documented the entire process with custom visualizations and fully reproducible code using knitr

Just sharing here because why not.
